# PrimeFinding
## (c) Autumn Bauman 2021
This is some python I wrote to find prime numbers. This is mainly a benchmark for
systems.

Feel free to make improvements to this code if you want.

This was inspired by Dave's Garage ()[David Plumber Github](github.com/davepl))
and his recent video benchmarking cpp, python, and c#. I looked over his code and
created my own which does the same stuff, but somehow it is considerably faster than
his despite me not being nearly as experienced as him in coding.  

This is all free software under the GPLv3, so have fun with it!
